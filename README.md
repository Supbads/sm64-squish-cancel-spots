Requires [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and (OpenGL)[https://www.opengl.org/] which comes by default with the Win SDK. Uses GLFW and I've statically included the 32bit binary for ease of use.

Fork from branpk aka. bad_boot's project. His ReadMe:
Very old and hacked-together code for finding squish cancel spots (used to create visuals for [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7ztTG2NxrE) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh5eTwBbzFs)).
If this is needed again for an A press save or major TAS, I'd be happy to clean it up and generalize it, but for now you'll have to modify it yourself if you want to use it.
